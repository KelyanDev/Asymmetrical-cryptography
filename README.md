# Asymmetrical-cryptography
## WORK IN PROGRESS

Python programs used to crypt decrypt messages, separated in 2 files:
  + one file create both public and private keys
  + one file encrypt/decrypt the message
  
### Goals:

My goal here is to build an encryption program while not using any of the existing library that could do it instantly.
As I want to understand how asymmetrical cryptography works, and as I'am really interested in cybersecurity, I really wanted to explore how this program was build, so no crypto library here.
